# Future Features and Objectives:

- BookWorm streamlines the research and studying process for students and scholars by improving users' browsing experience and remodeling bookmark management.

## Objective: BookWorm helps student study more effectively by turning webpages to become distraction free and interactive with a portfolio homepage organizer to allow student manage their research data and open tabs.

### Features:
- Google Translate

- Distraction free mode automatically erases distracting environment and takes out unnecessary text on the sides
   - Sets all the fonts to the same font style for any webpage that you choose. (automatic) 
   - Can set the webpage to become non scrolling Webpage will hide everything but the first header and its paragraph. The header will be at the top of the page with   the paragraphs. Pushing the right arrow key will continue to the next section and its header and paragraph context.
   
- Active Reading mode that changes the layout of the web pages by editing its format into a more active readable content which also contains a dropdown summary of each paragraph. (*This allows the student to actually interact with their source and webpages resulting to more productive research and better retention of information.*)

- A keyword section that holds relevant key terms that the user decides to keep and have those words be automatically searched for its definition.

- Tags: can tag keywords in websites when tag mode is activated. Allows student to link and correlate the keywords with the subject they are researching as well as allows relevant webpages to be categorized and searched by. Tags will be saved in portfolio album where webpage is if created.can

- At the bottom of the webpage will be a section that contains other relevant websites based on the tags highlighted by the user. Don’t open a webpage twice if already opened (arrow pointed up at the bottom to show more relevant website pictures, scroll through to see the relevant next ones.)

- Deleting elements of the page that you don't want.

- Fullscreen Mode

- Comment/Note sections (like Google Docs comment) that can note down highlighted sections and allow you to make comments on them. Comments and highlighted text will remain when the user returns to the webpages.

- **portfolio homepage** that is customizable, holds albums of webpages that users would like to save. The homepage also displays the most recent user-designated keywords and highlighted notes so that when the user returns to it, they can refresh their memory with the key terms they highlighted as well as the notes and websites that they last went to (along with clickable link to the webpage). The homepage contains also a todo list of the key things the user needs to do or questions the user seeks an answer to.

In portfolio homepage there will be:
*album/project*:
   - Search History (for each project/album in Portfolio): you can order history search by tags, number of clicks, time spent on webpages, latest clicked on, etc.
   - When looking into an album, new websites for further research will be suggested. A preview of those websites will be displayed.
   - User clicks on album and it has options to open up the webpages in the album. 
   - Albums can be merged together
   - Albums can be organized and reordered around including the tabs itself.

- Sessions: when a new tab is created on a separate window, the user can create a new project folder or select an existing project folder and any search queries and pages visited will automatically go to the album of that project in the portfolio homepage. The user can undo this with a hotkey/button.
   - The new session can be a part of a created project
   
When opening a browser:

homepage pops up to suggest search queries based on the most recently created tags or web pages visited.

Rants/Food for thought:

- A schedule/calendar?

- Record the session you are on silently??

- Could even possibly maybe show the current tabs you are on when on the portfolio homepage tab???

- SWITCHING SESSIONS WITH SAVED PROJECTS/ALBUM!!! A functionatlity that can DEFINITELY be part of the web extension

- Undo option

- MUST MAKE IT SUPER DUPER SIMPLE FOR THE USER... Looking at Session Buddy.... simple easy to use and has the desired functionality for the large target audience BUT needs to be saved in the cloud, it is da way (look at SB's review)

- Text to speech. MAYBE even try to read productivity books/ read its summary (saves people time by reading it at our pace not theirs... ie some books take up to 17 minutes to listen to but reading it yourself takes forever.) but this is like a long term thing.

- *Automatic tab organizer, using AI and NLP? to match the relevant tabs in a session based on their similarity. Group them together and suggest groupings...

- See Grammarly functionalities. BUT if under quotation, don't highlight the errors/grammar mistakes.
   - - Highlighting automatically defines word? Like grammarly
   

- If you make a search query, the search engine will match your search terms with web page content that is in someone else's words. It would be nice if YOU could write your own words and thoughts about the text and have the search engine match YOUR search terms with YOUR own words because YOU are more familiar with words that YOU write yourself than with the web page content that is written by someone else. This can be implemented by letting users take notes on the web page and matching search terms with those notes.

Unlooked benefits of a portfolio homepage:
- Saves tabs that are open and restores them later, frees up memory and avoids tab cluttering
- Can be created as a todo list, for work that needs to continue research on/ or a form that u need submitted can be added to this album



### Implementation Details:

- If no funding: 
   - All data can be stored locally on the user's computer (which eliminates the need for cloud storage of user information). Perhaps the extension can read the website URL and rewrite the entire displayed page if the URL is one of ours (for example, bookworm.com/porfoliopage/)
